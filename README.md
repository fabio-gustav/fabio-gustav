Hey I'm Shane, a Computer Science student working on a bunch of cool projects. My focuses are:
- Embedded Systems
- Microcontrollers
- Game Development
- High Performance Computing

I usually end up working in C++, but I've bounced around to C#, Python, and Java as needed. I'm currently working on a couple of things but my favorite would have to be a custom smart watch I am in the process of designing.
